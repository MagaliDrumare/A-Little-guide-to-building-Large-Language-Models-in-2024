## ðŸŽ¯ Focus on a Little guide to building Large Language Models in 2024 
This is a post-recording of a 75min lecture I gave two weeks ago on how to train a LLM from scratch in 2024. I tried to keep it short and comprehensive â€“ focusing on concepts that are crucial for training good LLM but often hidden in tech reports.

In the lecture, I introduce the students to all the important concepts/tools/techniques for training good performance LLM:
* Finding, preparing and evaluating web scale data
  * Datasets examples : Cosmopedia v1.0  https://github.com/huggingface/cosmopedia , Starcoder2  https://github.com/bigcode-project/starcoder2/
  * Filter Data tools by Meta : https://fasttext.cc/
  * Process and deduplicate text data at a very large scale: https://github.com/huggingface/datatrove
  * Evaluating the data with Face LightEval is a lightweight LLM evaluation : https://github.com/huggingface/lighteval


* Understanding model parallelism and efficient training
* Fine-tuning/aligning models
* Fast inference

### Video Poet 
To showcase VideoPoet's capabilities, we have produced a short movie composed of many short clips generated by the model. For the script, we asked Bard to write a series of prompts to detail a short story about a traveling raccoon. We then generated video clips for each prompt, and stitched together all resulting clips to produce the final YouTube Short below

### LATTE3D 
The LATTE3D model rapidly transforms text prompts into high-quality 3D shapes that could help populate virtual worlds.
